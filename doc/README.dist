     *          GAPT: General Architecture for Proof Theory          *
      ***************************************************************

GAPT is a proof theory framework developed primarily at the Vienna University
of Technology. GAPT contains data structures, algorithms, parsers and other
components common in proof theory and automated deduction. In contrast to
automated and interactive theorem provers whose focus is the construction of
proofs, GAPT concentrates on the transformation and further processing of
proofs.
